  * Missing functions:
    + stdio:
      - fscanf
      - fgetws, fgetwc, ungetwc
    + zlib functions (eg. libpng)
    + divert crc checks or recompute checksums (yeah)

  * Detect crashes in the program's stdout/stderr (eg. mplayer) instead of
    just checking the return value

  * Parallelise operations (for clock-constrained programs unable to work
    at fullest speed)

  * Socket support (networking)

  * Marker support (eg. \r\n\r\n in HTTP responses)

  * ASCII support, UTF-8 support
