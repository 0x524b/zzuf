1. About Zzuf

Zzuf is a transparent application input fuzzer. It works by intercepting
file operations and changing random bits in the program's input. Zzuf's
behaviour is deterministic, making it easy to reproduce bugs.


2. Example

Fuzz the input of the "cat" program using default settings:

  # zzuf cat /etc/motd

Fuzz 1% of the input bits of the "cat" program using seed 94324:

  # zzuf -s 94324 -r 0.01 cat /etc/motd

Fuzz the input of the "convert" program, using file foo.jpeg as the original
input and excluding .xml files from fuzzing (because convert will also open
its own configuration files and we do not want zzuf to fuzz them):

  # zzuf -E '\.xml$' convert -- foo.jpeg -format tga /dev/null

Fuzz the input of VLC, using file movie.avi as the original input and
restricting fuzzing to filenames that appear on the command line, then
generate fuzzy-movie.avi which is a file that can be fed to VLC to reproduce
the behaviour without using zzuf:

  # zzuf -c -s 87423 -r 0.01 vlc movie.avi

  # zzuf -c -s 87423 -r 0.01 cp movie.avi fuzzy-movie.avi
  # vlc fuzzy-movie.avi

Fuzz mplayer's input with seeds 0 to 9999 and kill processes that take more
than one minute to read the movie file:

  # zzuf -c -q -s 0:10000 -T 60 -r 0.02 \
         mplayer movie.avi -- -benchmark -vo null -fps 1000

Same as above with up to 15 simultaneous child processes because we are
playing a sound file:

  # zzuf -c -F 15 -q -s 0:10000 -T 60 -r 0.02 \
         mplayer song.mp3 -- -benchmark -ao null
